## Deliverables

- **HTML File:** Structure your banner within an HTML file named `index.html`.
- **CSS File:** Style your banner using a CSS file named `styles.css`.
- **JavaScript File:** Include any necessary interactive elements or animations with a JavaScript file named `script.js`.
- **Assets:** Include any assets that need to be referenced.

- **Dimensions:** The banner should be exactly 300x250 pixels.
- **Layout:**
  - Please follow the video mock below as precisely as possible with placement and animations. This does not need to be pixel perfect, but we just want to see a solid grasp of HTML/CSS/Javascript.
  - Include a persistent disclaimer at the bottom of the banner with a smaller font size that is legible.
  - All text can be Lorem Ipsum
- **Assets:** Use attached logo and background image - you can also try using css for the background that somewhat matches the visual mock.
<!-- ![](./assets/background.jpg) -->
<img src="./assets/background.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

<!-- ![](./assets/logo.png) -->
<img src="./assets/logo.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>  

- **Fonts:** Choose a web-safe font or include a Google Fonts link for a font that closely matches the sample. Ensure the font sizes are readable and scale appropriately to the size of the banner.
- **Content:**
  - Please follow the included video 
  - The main area of the banner should include placeholder text. Use Lorem Ipsum for any text content.
  - The bottom section should have a scrolling disclaimer text. Implement the scrolling effect using vanilla JavaScript.

## Functional Requirements

- **Interactivity:**
  - The banner must include a scrolling disclaimer text at the bottom. This should automatically scroll indefinitely.
  - Ensure that the scrolling is smooth and continuous.

## Testing and Compatibility

- Test your banner in at least two different web browsers (e.g., Chrome and Firefox) to ensure consistency in appearance and functionality.
- Document any browser-specific considerations or issues you encounter and how you addressed them.

## Submission Instructions

- Bundle your `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and asset files into a zip file named `[YourName]-WebDisplayBanner.zip`.
- Write a brief README document explaining your design choices, any challenges you faced, and how to view the banner in a browser.
- Share a Github Repository with your code and the ZIP file with the following users: 
[Nauman Hafiz](https://www.github.com/canisvulgaris)
[Joanne Liu](https://github.com/jliucreative)
- OR Email the zip file and the README document to people@helloconstellation.com.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Adherence to Design:** The banner matches the layout and aesthetic of the provided sample image.
- **Code Quality:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code should be clean, well-organized, and commented where necessary.
- **Functionality:** All elements display as described, with smooth and continuous animations.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** The banner should look consistent and function properly across the tested web browsers.

Good luck with your exercise, and we look forward to seeing your creative implementation!
