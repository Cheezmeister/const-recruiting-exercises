# Constellation > Quality Assurance Test Automation > Take-Home Project

## Introduction

This take-home project is called the **Trello Board**. This tool is a basic Task Management Board similar to Trello or Jira, where you can create/edit/update tasks and move them across a few columns.

## Take-Home Overview

The goal of the Take-Home is to test your ability to write a few Cypress tests to validate key workdflows in this web app.

## Getting Started

First step is to clone this repository.

In order to run the application locally, you will need `node` (version 16 or greater should work) as well as `yarn` or `npm`.

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the app locally using this command:

```bash
yarn start
```

Once the app has started, you should be able to acces it in your browser at this url:

http://localhost:3000/

## Take-Home Test Requirements

The core goals for this take-home are as follows:
    - Add Cypress to the Project
    - Write at least 3 Cypress tests that you feel are important to automate for this application

Some examples of tests could be:
    - Adding a new Card
    - Editing an existing Card
    - Editing a Column Title
    - Moving a Card from one column to another

## Estimated Time

The project should take around 3 - 6 hours. Please get through as many requirements as
possible.

## Review Criteria

You will be reviewed for your Cypress setup, test standards, test readability, css selectors, and overall code quality.
